Hello, guys.

00:04.890 --> 00:07.440
After launching Spider, we seen The View.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.440
We'll briefly describe the layout of this program.

00:10.740 --> 00:15.690
Some of us may have a slightly different user interface due to recent program updates.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.030
I also said the Vanguard theme.

00:18.300 --> 00:23.040
You can do it in the tools preferences setup and through the preferred theme.

00:23.460 --> 00:25.410
I will stay with this because I like it.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.550
On the left, we have a window in which we can write our python code.

00:33.390 --> 00:39.030
On the right, we have a window with some additional information that facilitates working with the program.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.250
One of them is a variable explorer where we can see defined variables.

00:44.610 --> 00:48.600
This is very helpful, especially for beginners in Python.

00:49.800 --> 00:56.280
Another is file explorer eight to where we can view the current folders and files in our working directory.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.760
And below we have a console that will display our results.

01:00.270 --> 01:06.630
If you want to check our working directory, we can use the p w the print working directory command.

01:07.140 --> 01:13.920
The path to our working directory will be displayed, which is theophilus user slash username.

01:14.580 --> 01:21.030
This is the default path to my home directory and we have the same thing in the toolbar to change the

01:21.030 --> 01:22.350
working directory.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.570
We can do this in at least two ways.

01:24.900 --> 01:31.260
We can click on the folder icon and select the exact working directory or enter the path manually.

01:31.560 --> 01:36.060
Let's try to choose the directory where we want to have our five.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.440
I keep all the repositories in the rebels directory.

01:42.990 --> 01:49.950
If we go to the file Explorer, we can see the folders in our working directory and here we will create

01:49.950 --> 01:53.280
a directory in which we can store files about our records.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.540
Let's give the name Python, underscore curve and click.

01:57.540 --> 01:57.990
Okay.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.540
The directory has been created.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.250
This directory empty.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.610
We can see that the path name has been changed.

02:05.790 --> 02:11.300
If we now use the p.w dx command, we already have our catalog of Corus.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.600
I recommend you make up directory and store all five here.

02:16.260 --> 02:19.890
Now we will create the first file in our working directory.

02:20.220 --> 02:23.070
Right click, then new file.

02:23.790 --> 02:25.770
Then we give the name of our file.

02:26.110 --> 02:29.430
Zero one underscore enter dot p.

02:29.910 --> 02:33.600
P is the python file extension by default.

02:33.630 --> 02:40.290
A new window will open with our file, which is empty and saved in our working directory to feed the

02:40.290 --> 02:41.290
parent folder.

02:41.310 --> 02:44.370
We can click the up arrow to return.

02:44.380 --> 02:48.060
We can double click on the python under the characters directory.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.170
That's all.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.550
We are ready to go further.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.080
Thank you for watching, Feel.

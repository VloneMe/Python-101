WEBVTT

00:03.780 --> 00:07.260
And let's go to the practical use of our Google Call up tool.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.960
Google CoLab consists of 12.

00:10.530 --> 00:18.990
We have two types of cells are called cell and text that we can at each fold by clicking here called

00:18.990 --> 00:20.220
for our tech cell.

00:20.670 --> 00:24.690
We can also add in by hovering in the center of the screen.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.600
If we don't need this, we can easily remove it.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.270
You can change their order, etc..

00:41.660 --> 00:44.960
We also have other options that are worth mentioning.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.240
Let's delete everything.

00:49.450 --> 00:56.380
We have an empty notebook to start a raffle with our coat and enter a simple called.

00:57.430 --> 00:59.650
Let's define the variable revenue.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.390
10,000.

01:05.860 --> 01:11.380
Then the variable tax 0.19 tax rate and income.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.340
It is equal to revenue multiplied by tax.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.440
And let's display it.

01:21.530 --> 01:25.760
Rounded gold saved plus enter the value have been displayed.

01:26.810 --> 01:29.840
We can also print it using that print function.

01:30.830 --> 01:32.330
Let's move to the next cell.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.580
Let's try to describe what we did.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.010
We will add a text at the very top and enter the header to edit.

01:40.010 --> 01:45.110
Also double click or press enter to add the edge free header.

01:45.290 --> 01:49.840
Enter the free characters hash and enter faith.

01:53.060 --> 01:57.590
If we go to the table of contents, we will have disaffection.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.650
If we create the next section, for example.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.250
Summary.

02:09.080 --> 02:14.300
We can see that the next section is created and we can navigate easily on the same level.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.360
Here we can also add more sections.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.590
We can always go to this table of contents here.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.650
Okay, we are closing the table of contents.

02:24.950 --> 02:28.550
Let's go back to our tool and now let's go to the examples.

02:29.210 --> 02:35.690
Now I'll show you how to import libraries in our environment for libraries that are in the Google call

02:35.690 --> 02:36.560
up environment.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.480
We do it in a standard way.

02:38.870 --> 02:44.870
We can execute the command import non-peak and b let's also display the library version.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.150
Sift love enter to execute.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.450
Carla provides the option of autocomplete.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.190
Let's see how it works.

02:56.790 --> 03:01.530
After entering and P, we have a handle on what we can use here.

03:05.740 --> 03:13.030
For example, we can enter a random and we also have more hands on the wall we can use, for example,

03:13.030 --> 03:13.960
around function.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.570
After opening the parenthesis, we also have information about the function.

03:27.230 --> 03:33.980
We can also get it by inserting a question mark and the running of the documentation will be displayed

03:33.980 --> 03:35.090
in a separate window.

03:35.930 --> 03:36.720
Let's move on.

03:36.740 --> 03:39.500
Let's see what to do if the library is not installed.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.960
We'll try to import the image.

03:41.970 --> 03:47.060
A library which we don't have here in Google call up environment.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.830
We have an error.

03:48.830 --> 03:49.130
No.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.750
Module name image i.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.270
What we have to do is to install the library.

03:55.480 --> 04:00.060
So enter exclamation mark, pip install Image II.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.670
Let's surround this command and we have to wait a moment.

04:05.110 --> 04:10.930
The library has been installed and we can now import it, import image AI.

04:10.930 --> 04:13.900
And so we see we have no error anymore.

04:15.010 --> 04:18.080
What is a nice feature of call up in case of error.

04:18.100 --> 04:25.210
We can quickly go to the Google and search for information about the error on the StackOverflow website.

04:25.810 --> 04:32.440
After clicking, we'll get Google search results where then we can quickly go to the problem we are

04:32.440 --> 04:33.400
interested in.

04:33.970 --> 04:38.800
Let's go back and move on to markdown language where you see some basic features.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.050
Let's add a new text file.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.820
We start with the font.

04:59.330 --> 05:02.870
If we want to italicize, we use the one asterisk.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.670
If we want to make the text bold, we use double asterisk.

05:09.430 --> 05:13.900
Remember as two spaces at the end of each line to go to the new line.

05:14.530 --> 05:17.860
We can also get it by adding to underscore, refine.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.680
If we want to pass a piece of code.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.790
We used the Berkeley character.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.520
If we want to pass a longer piece of code, we do this in this way.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.740
We pass free back to characters.

05:41.620 --> 05:44.830
If we want to end and we can do it in this way.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.810
To add a double indent, we add another sign.

05:58.580 --> 06:01.550
Next, let's see how to create an ordered list.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.470
To create an order placed.

06:20.470 --> 06:22.390
We put an asterisk symbol.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.470
Now I show you how to insert a link to our page.

06:39.950 --> 06:42.770
Let's go to google dot com and copy darling.

06:46.860 --> 06:51.960
Let's up a new text so the text will be displayed in a square brackets.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.420
And the page address is in the wrong bracket.

06:57.990 --> 07:01.140
After clicking, a new window will open with our link.

07:06.580 --> 07:12.160
If we want to attack the image, we can do it as follows and throw an exclamation mark.

07:12.200 --> 07:18.310
Then the square brackets put the text to be displayed and in into round brackets the link to the image

07:18.790 --> 07:21.160
will copy the link to the Python logo.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.890
Right click copy.

07:25.890 --> 07:26.730
Image Address.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.960
And posted here.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.440
Now I show you how to use mathematical equations using logic.

07:38.010 --> 07:39.120
Let's create a new text.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.470
So we pass mathematical formula and clothing to all our signs.

07:43.950 --> 07:45.240
Let's see how to do it.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.160
On the right, we have our preview.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.680
Let's make another example.

07:49.950 --> 07:52.640
Let's start with our fraction and the fun.

07:52.650 --> 07:53.040
Fine.

08:19.270 --> 08:20.590
To build a matrix.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.270
Let's see another example.

08:22.690 --> 08:26.650
We are building out two by two matrix backslash.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.630
Begin P matrix.

08:29.350 --> 08:31.600
Then we have elements of matrix.

08:33.950 --> 08:34.940
a11.

08:40.590 --> 08:41.550
A one, two.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.650
Go to the new line, double backslash.

08:51.120 --> 08:51.750
Two one.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.500
A total.

09:02.170 --> 09:05.560
And finish our matrix and B matrix.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.160
Let's see the tables.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.260
Let's build a simple table.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.670
Three columns, two rows.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.410
We start with headers.

09:18.590 --> 09:23.090
Call one vertical bar code or vertical bar code free.

09:23.630 --> 09:27.830
Then we pass dash does does vertical bar dash dash.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.140
That vertical bar doesn't touch that.

09:30.890 --> 09:39.650
And we go to the first row value on vertical bar wall to vertical bar wall free and they're like, throw.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.230
And we are ready to go that fall.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.690
We are ready to go further.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.730
Thank you for watching.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.190
Feel.

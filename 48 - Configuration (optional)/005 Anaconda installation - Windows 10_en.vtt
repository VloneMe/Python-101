Hello, guys.

00:04.910 --> 00:08.540
And this today I will show you how to install Anaconda on Windows.

00:09.320 --> 00:15.620
We open our browser, in my case Google Chrome type Anaconda and click on the first link.

00:16.460 --> 00:19.730
Let's go to the download section and let's go down.

00:20.210 --> 00:26.030
Make sure you have the version selected for your operating system and click the download button under

00:26.030 --> 00:28.070
Python version 3.7.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.880
The file has less than 500 megabytes, so we have to wait a moment until our files download it.

00:35.330 --> 00:39.110
During this time, we can see something about the Anaconda distribution.

00:39.440 --> 00:45.980
Anaconda is an open source environment and it's one of the easiest way to start working with Python.

00:46.460 --> 00:51.560
The platform puts emphasis on the working in the field of data science and machine learning.

00:51.950 --> 00:57.500
Anaconda contains a lot of libraries that are already included with the Anaconda distribution.

00:57.950 --> 01:03.800
Such libraries of NumPy pandas could learn TensorFlow, Seabourn and many more.

01:04.460 --> 01:04.880
Okay.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.770
However, file has been downloaded.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.150
We can run it now.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.050
Click next.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.720
Then accept the license agreement.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.530
Leave just me recommended.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.150
And click next.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.480
Leave the default path.

01:27.260 --> 01:33.470
Select the option app anaconda to my environment variable and click installer.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.440
Installation will take a while.

01:45.290 --> 01:45.810
Okay.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.350
Our installation has been successfully completed.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.340
Click next.

01:49.550 --> 01:51.260
Again next and finish.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.800
And now we can start our anaconda.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.960
Enter Anaconda in your search bar and click on Anaconda Navigator.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.180
The first running of the program takes a little longer than standard.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.780
Our Anaconda Navigator distribution have been launched.

02:22.170 --> 02:23.820
What we will use is Spider.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.710
Now we will run it.

02:25.980 --> 02:26.790
Click on launch.

02:27.090 --> 02:28.940
This is the version of Spider.

02:28.950 --> 02:29.640
3.2.

02:29.670 --> 02:30.510
3.6.

02:33.230 --> 02:36.020
This is what our program looks like by default.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.840
However, we will adjust it slightly.

02:39.900 --> 02:48.690
Let's click on the panel of preferences and set the font to 14 so it will be clearly seen in the videos.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.650
And we'll also change the theme.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.750
Let's go to the syntax coloring tab.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.780
And here we have a choice of several themes that we like.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.350
For example, I can choose Molokai or some other theme.

03:05.890 --> 03:07.500
I chose the vendor theme.

03:07.510 --> 03:09.610
It seems to me the most interesting.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.620
Then click Apply.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.280
Now we can have additional options in the editor.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.870
Here we can see all options.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.190
I think that another interesting option is the option in the advanced settings.

03:21.190 --> 03:24.340
Stop where we can add automatic closing quotes.

03:27.050 --> 03:27.590
And click.

03:27.590 --> 03:28.030
Okay.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.020
Let's see if our program works.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.600
Let's try Helloworld in Python.

03:39.630 --> 03:42.780
Now let's try to start the program with the green button.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.840
Click around and we see that our program works.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.390
That text have been printed to the council.

03:49.020 --> 03:55.020
We can comment this piece of code in a separate file and now we have two files that we can execute the

03:55.020 --> 03:56.010
code separately.

03:56.460 --> 03:59.100
Shortcut for this is saved plus enter.

03:59.610 --> 04:00.300
That's all.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.710
We are ready to go further.

04:01.710 --> 04:02.760
Thank you for watching.

04:02.770 --> 04:03.210
Feel.

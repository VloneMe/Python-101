00:04.010 --> 00:04.730
Hello, guys.

00:04.820 --> 00:09.020
Now I will show you how to connect Google call up with the GitHub platform.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.090
Let's open a new window.

00:11.390 --> 00:13.310
Enter GitHub dot com.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.080
Log into your account.

00:20.380 --> 00:23.410
And I have to type my verification code.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.190
And so we are already locked into the guitar platform.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.010
We will create our test repository.

00:35.310 --> 00:41.490
So let's go to the repository tab, then click new.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.470
And give the name of the repository.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.000
Let it be test and call up.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.300
Then we leave the public repository.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.630
And we will add the read me file.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.400
And create our repository.

01:04.850 --> 01:06.530
And we have to wait a moment.

01:06.950 --> 01:07.450
Okay.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.140
Our repository is ready.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.770
We want to save the colored notebook in this repository.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.740
Let's go back to the notebook.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.400
Love that piece of code.

01:16.970 --> 01:19.700
So, for example, simple hello world.

01:20.390 --> 01:25.190
Let's run this code and we'll save such a notebook on the guitar platform.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.510
Click File.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.970
Then next, save a copy and GitHub.

01:29.330 --> 01:32.360
And we need to wait for authorization for a while.

01:32.990 --> 01:35.780
And now we have to choose a repository.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.560
So here we choose our repository that we've created.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.140
In our case, test the scallop.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.220
Then we have to choose branch.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.530
We only have a master.

01:45.950 --> 01:47.360
So let's give the final name.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.180
And we can change the message.

01:53.990 --> 01:54.500
And click.

01:54.500 --> 01:54.920
Okay.

01:56.410 --> 01:57.430
Wait a moment.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.890
At this moment, a copy is created.

02:00.730 --> 02:01.740
And let's see.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.060
We are in the test call up repository.

02:04.330 --> 02:07.690
We have a template file and our file is ready.

02:08.230 --> 02:10.330
We can go back to our repository.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.160
Let's try to refresh it and see that this template file is ready.

02:17.380 --> 02:21.250
18 seconds ago after opening this file.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.200
We have our notebook ready.

02:23.740 --> 02:28.270
We can open it again into Google call up to click, open in, call up.

02:28.630 --> 02:33.010
We have to wait a moment and have a notebook ready to work here.

02:33.050 --> 02:37.030
We also have information that the notebook is stored on data.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.300
Now let's connect to the instance in the cloud.

02:45.760 --> 02:53.590
Hence right around our called Shift Center, we have a warning click around anyway and our colt was

02:53.590 --> 02:54.310
executed.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.420
We'll add another hello.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.160
Call up Colt and save the notebook on the guitar platform again.

03:03.030 --> 03:05.220
Fail safe a copy and get help.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.440
Four values are already substituted.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.670
Repository name.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.060
Branch file name.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.240
We can confirm by clicking.

03:17.240 --> 03:17.780
Okay.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.160
Wait a moment.

03:23.610 --> 03:25.560
And we have prepared a template file.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.080
Let's go back to our repository.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.370
The template for early 3D.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.120
And this way we can work with the her platform and Google call up.

03:38.810 --> 03:39.500
That's all.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.880
We are ready to go further.

03:40.910 --> 03:41.960
Thank you for watching.

03:41.990 --> 03:42.410
See you.

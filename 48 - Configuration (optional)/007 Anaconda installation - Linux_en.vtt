Hello, guys.

00:04.210 --> 00:07.660
Now I show you how to install Anaconda Navigator on Linux.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.270
Specifically this going on.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.130
Let's open our browser.

00:13.990 --> 00:18.390
Enter how to install Anaconda on or want to kick the first link.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.090
And we have a list of commands that we have to follow step by step.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.640
Let's open the terminal.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.860
At the beginning.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.820
Let's go to the temp directory.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.060
Then we can list what is here.

00:36.210 --> 00:43.260
We start by downloading the installation file folder, copy the given command and paste it into the

00:43.260 --> 00:43.920
terminal.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.370
Click Enter during this time.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.900
Our file is downloading.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.190
We have to wait a moment.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.440
At this time, we can go for the next installation of depth and see what we will do next.

00:58.770 --> 01:00.210
Step three we can skip.

01:00.630 --> 01:04.500
Then we're on the bus script to install Anaconda environment.

01:04.770 --> 01:09.930
Then we accept the license terms, accept the default path where Anaconda will be installed.

01:10.140 --> 01:14.220
In example, home flashing of our flash anaconda free.

01:14.850 --> 01:18.420
Finally, activate the installation and then we can test that.

01:18.420 --> 01:25.860
The installation will also create our test environment for Python version three, then activate the

01:25.860 --> 01:29.790
created environment and finally launch Anaconda Navigator.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.550
Okay, we have the file downloaded.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.310
Now copy the next command and press.

01:35.310 --> 01:35.880
Enter.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.170
Press enter.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.290
Then we accept the license terms.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.430
Entry.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.460
If we confirm the default location.

01:44.790 --> 01:45.060
Hit.

01:45.060 --> 01:45.570
Enter.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.410
And I count up against things, though this process will also take a while.

01:54.300 --> 01:54.680
Okay.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.460
The installation will successful.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.340
Let's see if they can do list command works.

02:05.410 --> 02:05.700
Come on.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.860
Not found because we haven't yet activated the installation.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.780
We need to run this command.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.180
And let's execute Condor list.

02:21.900 --> 02:27.150
Now, all the library's installed in our base environment have been listed.

02:29.720 --> 02:37.430
We can now create an environment with a command conduct create wave flag that last name and name test

02:37.430 --> 02:37.940
band of.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.820
We create an environment and 30th.

02:50.030 --> 02:54.460
We can now activate the environment by entering conduct activities.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.130
Pandef.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.200
We feel that the name has been changed.

03:05.220 --> 03:12.150
We are in the test band environment and we can use the Condor list to list all the libraries installed

03:12.150 --> 03:13.440
in the environment.

03:19.750 --> 03:26.440
We don't have any so we can install in the example pandas library conda install pandas.

03:31.230 --> 03:35.430
This command will install the Pandas library and its dependencies.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.460
Accept the F.

03:50.870 --> 03:53.750
Now we can list all of our instant libraries.

03:54.050 --> 03:59.360
We can see that all the dependencies on which the library is based have been installed.

04:00.200 --> 04:05.900
Now to run Anaconda, navigate our program, we can run the Anaconda Navigator Command in the terminal.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.930
At this moment, we start the Anaconda Navigator program, and we can use this program as one window.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.740
Let's try running, Spider.

04:23.770 --> 04:25.870
It will start with the default settings.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.050
Okay?

04:32.060 --> 04:32.580
Nothing.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.990
We are ready to go further.

04:34.010 --> 04:35.040
Thank you for watching.

04:35.060 --> 04:35.480
Feel.

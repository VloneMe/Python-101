Hello, guys.

00:04.850 --> 00:08.240
Let's move on to the next role that I highly recommend to you.

00:08.570 --> 00:12.110
This tool is called Google Callable or Tree Oracle up for short.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.840
To open this store, let's go to Google Drive.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.820
Open your favorite browser.

00:16.970 --> 00:18.530
I recommend Google Chrome.

00:18.860 --> 00:25.910
If you are not logged in place, logged into your Google account and to let type Google drive or drive

00:25.910 --> 00:28.070
for short in the search bar.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.400
And then click the first link.

00:34.050 --> 00:34.950
Go to drive.

00:37.460 --> 00:38.530
And here we go.

00:38.540 --> 00:43.610
We have our Google Drive account to go to the Google Call Up Tool, Click New.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.240
More and go go callable lottery.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.160
Wait a second.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.270
That all will open.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.010
Okay.

00:55.010 --> 00:55.940
And we are here.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.460
Okay.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.630
Now we can change the notebook name.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.610
For example, intro.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.220
And save change of file.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.660
Save our control and we'll within seconds.

01:09.660 --> 01:17.430
The location, file, locating, drive and new tab will open with our notebook location.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.220
And here we have our file intro.

01:20.670 --> 01:24.240
Okay, let's close this tab and come back to the notebook.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.340
What is callable on tree?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.810
Google callable tree.

01:27.810 --> 01:35.370
Oracle up for short allows us to write and execute by phone in our browser with zero configuration required

01:35.580 --> 01:38.370
free access to GPO and easy sharing.

01:38.700 --> 01:45.180
Whether you're a student or a data scientist or AI researcher, collab can make your work easier.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.640
In other words, CoLab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Google.

01:50.640 --> 01:56.640
Call up that document we are watching now with an interactive environment called a colored notebook

01:56.730 --> 02:03.570
that let us write and execute cold lab notebooks, allow us to combine executable code and reach text

02:03.570 --> 02:07.560
in a single document, along with image of HDMI and more.

02:07.890 --> 02:12.720
When you create your own call up notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account.

02:13.020 --> 02:18.660
You can easily share your Google CoLab notebooks with your co-workers or friends, allowing them to

02:18.660 --> 02:21.450
comment on your notebooks or even added them.

02:22.230 --> 02:30.330
And log book is a list of self serve contain either explanatory text or executable code and its output.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.410
We need to connect today's task to be able to execute the code.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.660
So let's click connect button.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.790
This take a while.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.140
Connecting.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.400
Initializing.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.580
And now we can use our notebook and stuff.
